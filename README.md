- Rating values (rating, review count, best rating, worst rating)
- Telephone number
- Website 
- Social Links (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, Google+, Youtube)
- Opening and closing hours
- Geo information (latitude, longitude)


# GetLinks.py

This class get all company links in categories you selected. Then save it to 'curl.txt'

# getvalue.py

Bad news... I dont know how to add links to array in python class (maybe I didnt try :P).
So you need to copy all data in 'curl.txt' and paste data array in this class

# GetCompanyData.py

This class get all company information and save to sqlite database.(You can change save function)
